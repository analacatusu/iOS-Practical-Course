# iOS Practical Course
This is a project that I worked on during the winter semester 2019/2020.
In a group of seven developers, we created an application called ***iMagine***, that runs on Apple devices. 

## iMagine
***iMagine*** is an _Augmented-Reality_-based proof of concept tool to help designers boost their own creativity. It lets users design a playground in AR, whilst constantly providing them with inspiring input. Using an advanced _neural network_, ***iMagine*** generates artificial user stories for the project. Users can also see a simulation of agents interacting with the world, as well as being able to record custom body gestures to place in the world.
***iMagine*** harnesses both the practical, but also the outlandish behavior of AI to help the designer become more creative.

## Project details
The ***iMagine*** app was developed in ```Swift```, mainly by using the newest ```ARKit 3.0``` at that time and the ```Xcode IDE```. The code is accessible on [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/ga27lep/). There is also an additional repo that contains some work that I did during the introduction week at this practical course. It mainly consist of small applications.

## Running the project
This project unfortunately only runs on ```MacOS```, where ```Xcode``` is downloaded. You should be able to clone the repository from [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/ga27lep/), import it into ```Xcode``` and run it. Since it is an _Augmented-Reality_ app, you will also need an Apple device. Simply connect it to the ```Mac``` and ```Xcode``` should ask for permission. 

## Client
This project was developed for **Siemens Mobile**.

## Additional Material
This repo contains the documentation of our whole project, including a step-by-step visualization of our app features. You can also check out [here](https://ase.in.tum.de/lehrstuhl_1/component/content/article/106-teaching/1063) our presentations and demos within the practical course. Scroll down to the **Siemens Mobile** project and you should be able to see our **Design Review** and **Client Acceptance Test (CAT)** presentations. Each of them take about 10 minutes.

## Main contribution
Within this project, I focused on developing the **Simulation** and the **Recording Actions** features. I also heavily contributed at **placing, deleting, moving and scaling 3D objects** within the world and at the **Speech Recognition** feature.
